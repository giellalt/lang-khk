* Sets for POS sub-categories





* Sets for Semantic tags





* Sets for Morphosyntactic properties






































































































































































* Sets for verbs


- V is all readings with a V tag in them, REAL-V should
be the ones without an N tag following the V.  
The REAL-V set thus awaits a fix to the preprocess V ... N bug.



* The set COPULAS is for predicative constructions







* NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features







* The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression **WORD - premodifiers**.












The set **NOT-NPMOD** is used to find barriers between NPs.
Typical usage: ... (*1 N BARRIER NPT-NPMOD) ...
meaning: Scan to the first noun, ignoring anything that can be
part of the noun phrase of that noun (i.e., "scan to the next NP head")






* Miscellaneous sets





















* Border sets and their complements













* Syntactic sets




These were the set types.



## HABITIVE MAPPING


* **hab1** 


* **hab2** 

* **hab3** (<hab> @ADVL>) for hab-actor and hab-case; if leat to the right, and Nom to the right of leat. Lots of restrictions.

* **hab4** 	



* **hab6** 

* **hab7** 

* **hab8** This is not HAB
* **hab5**  This is not HAB



* **habDain** (<hab> @ADVL>) for (Pron Dem Pl Loc) if leat followed by Nom to the right

B) same as a, only the Qst-pcle is attached to copulas. C) Qst to the left, with copulas to its left, but not if two Nom:s are found somewhere to the right. D) copulas to the left, and BOS to the left. E) Loc or Ill to the left, and Loc or Hab to the left of this, Qst and copulas to the left.

* **NumTime** (@<SPRED) for A Nom

* **<spredSg** (@<SPRED) for Sg Nom	

* **<spredPg** (@<SPRED) for Pl Nom	

* **<spred** (@<SPRED) for Nom; if copulas to the left, and Nom or sentence boundary to the left of copulas. First one to the right is EOS.

* **<spred** (@<SPRED) for N Ess

* **spredEss>** (@SPRED>) for N Ess; if copulas to the right of you, and if an NP with nom-case first one to your left.

* **HABSpredSg>** (@SPRED>) for Nom; if habitive first one to the left, followed by copulas.

* **GalleSpred>** (@SPRED>) for Num Nom; if sentence initial

* **SpredSg>Hab** (@SPRED>) for Nom; if you are sentence initial, copulas is located to the right, and there is a habitive to the right of copulas



* **Spred>SubjInf** (@SPRED>) for Nom; if copulas to the right, and the subject of copulas is an Inf to the right

* **spredCoord** (@<SPRED) coordination for Nom; only if there already is a SPRED to the left of CNP. Not if there is some kind of comparison involved.

## Sets containing sets of lists and tags

This part of the file lists a large number of sets based partly upon the tags defined above, and
partly upon lexemes drawn from the lexicon.
See the sourcefile itself to inspect the sets, what follows here is an overview of the set types.



### Sets for Single-word sets

INITIAL


### Sets for word or not

WORD
REAL-WORD
REAL-WORD-NOT-ABBR
NOT-COMMA


### Case sets

ADLVCASE

CASE-AGREEMENT
CASE

NOT-NOM
NOT-GEN
NOT-ACC

### Verb sets


NOT-V

### Sets for finiteness and mood

REAL-NEG

MOOD-V

NOT-PRFPRC


### Sets for person

SG1-V
SG2-V
SG3-V
DU1-V
DU2-V
DU3-V
PL1-V
PL2-V
PL3-V





### Pronoun sets

















### Adjectival sets and their complements




### Adverbial sets and their complements




### Sets of elements with common syntactic behaviour


### NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features








### The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression **WORD - premodifiers**.





















### Border sets and their complements











### Grammarchecker sets
